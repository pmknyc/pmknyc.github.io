After many years as a health psychology research scientist, I was ready to make a pivot in my career. I wanted to find a career that could draw on my professional experience yet perhaps offer opportunities to pursue other interests. This is the second big career adventure of my life, so I took a fascinating, fun and sometimes meandering journey to explore and research options. 

Why, then, did I decide to pursue becoming a software engineer? The reasons, it turned out, were easy to interpolate: 

```
reason_1 = "fun"
reason_2 = "plays to my strengths"
puts = "Coding is #{reason_1} and #{reason_2}."
```
